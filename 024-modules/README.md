# Week 11 JavaScript research: 
## After doing some research, I have a bit better understanding of JSON. It is not really its own language for standalone coding. It is a data file format for storing and transferring objects. It seems to mainly be used for JavaScript, but most other languages seem to have support for JSON as well. This makes it almost universal for most programmers. It stores objects, identifying them with unique names and values. Arrays and objects are set up very similarly using brackets and braces.

### I do understand the concept of using localStorage. I understand that the data we input before was only in RAM and was then volatile. I know now that setItem and getItem are used to save and retrieve to and from non-volatile, persistent storage. Implementing it myself will still be tricky for now.
### I think the code looks a bit more intimidating as a group of files, but individually, they do look neater. As far as what else should we do? Perhaps we could seperate the calculation functions and also find a way to get rid of the plain text that generates after submission and leave only the tables.
