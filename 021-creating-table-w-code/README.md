# Week 10 Creating Table With Code
## First Assignment

## where in code do we start to render the table:
## I am assuming it goes after our updateDOM. I think it would be put before the eventlistener

## I am guessing that we would call the render table and use appendChild in our mileage calculation functions

## I think it is because there are no links between the calculate functions and the table rendering. Perhaps we might need to call our calculation functions inside the render table function and get rid of the updateDOM code in the caalculation functions.

## I thought I could put the render table inside of an array and attempt to condense it that way, but I could not.

## I think we may have to remove the updateDOM calls from the calculation functions. I now know you were talkng about the table appearing twice after re-entering. Perhaps another form reset call is in order?

## I understand most of it, but I am stil trying to grasp the forEach loops and the object keys.
