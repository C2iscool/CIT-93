# WEEK 7

# I use dev tools but not nearly as much as what you seem to demonstrate in videos. I use it currently to find errors and compare the code from the browser to vscode. My live server extension updates flawlessly in real time so I do not refresh often.

# I know about objects from the previous semester. I also knew about arrays too. They make sense to me for organization and data storage purposes.
