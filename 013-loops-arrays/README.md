# I have not learned much more about dev tools than I already knew. I do not really use them much as of now. Should I? That is probably a maybe and most likely a must later on.

# For the refactor, it made sense to me. It made sense and did reduce the amount of lines while stil retaining readability and functionality.

# P.S. I apologize for the lack of activity from me. I was busy doing some stuff for people's birthdays. I hope to catch up on these assignments ASAP. Also as a heads up in case you need it, I will be gone most of next week for traveling and will be back some time in the week after. I thank you ver much for keeping the class structured the way it is right now. It allows me to much more easily do these things.
