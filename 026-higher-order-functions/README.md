# Week 12 Higher Order Functions

## A Higher Order Function is a function that accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function back to you once its done doing what its supposed to do.

### A First Order Function is pretty much any function that is not a Higher Order Function.

#### For example, array.filter() is a higher order function. You need to pass a function that includes logic to exclude something to filter something from an array. 

##### Using these higher order functions can clean up repetitive code. They can also help make functions much smaller in general.
