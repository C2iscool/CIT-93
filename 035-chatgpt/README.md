# ChatGPT thoughts: This was my first time actually using ChatGPT. I thought the answers it provided were helpful in a general sense. It did not go into a massive amount of detail, but it recommended solutions for different types of needs. This is a nice tool to point people in the right direction, but for now, it is no replacement for dedicated research and education.

# Video thoughts: I agree with the first guy interviewed. I do not think that AI is going to take over our lives like some people say. I see this as a huge evolution in computing, programming, and the internet. It may get rid of some jobs in some sectors or businesses, but not enough to be devastating. I think it would also create more for the ones it potentially replaces, and possibly make even more than that. Humans are ultimately the ones who created the code that made it possible. Humans will most likely be the head boss of AI technology. I also think that governments are also going to put limits on what people can effectively do with AI in the future. I think AI will be obviously weaponized and used to do evil things, but the potential for it to do good outweighs the potential negative impact.

# I was not able to get this working. I did not know how to get the key setup for the API. I did not know how to set up the headers either. It seemed like there was no JavaScript docs on the site.
